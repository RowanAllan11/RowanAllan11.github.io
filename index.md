## ðŸ’» PROJECTS <br>

ðŸ§¬ **AMRsplitter: A Workflow for Plasmid vs. Chromosome AMR Gene Localisation _(ongoing)_** <br>
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/RowanAllan11/AMRsplitter) <br>
- Developed and executed a comprehensive benchmarking workflow (composed in Snakemake) utilising 'ground truth' hybrid assemblies to investigate the challenge of accurately detecting chromosomally-integrated plasmids and associated Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) genes in _Salmonella enterica_ short-read assemblies.
- Demonstrated that existing plasmid classification tools significantly underperform in localizing AMR genes associated with single-event chromosomal integration (with one tool recording a 100% misclassification rate for chromosomal AMR genes); this work provides a rationale for prioritizing long-read sequencing for isolates where such integration events are suspected.

ðŸ§¬ **NMF L21 Normalisation: Molecular Cancer Class Discovery** <br>
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/RowanAllan11/NMF-L21-CancerClustering) <br>
- Developed a modular python framework implementing non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) models for
clustering high-dimensional biological datasets under the supervision of Dr. Haixuan Yang.
- Implemented normalisation techniques (max-norm, L21-norm) to assess robustness under noise and data
heterogeneity, achieving consistent results across 100+ runs.

ðŸ§  **Bachelors thesis: In Vivo Analysis of the Epigenetic Landscape in _Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus_** <br>
[View Poster (PDF)](PDFs/Poster.pdf) <br>
[Read full thesis (PDF)](PDFs/Thesis.pdf)
- Used comparative genomics (BLAST) and single-cell transcriptomics to identify a DNMT3a homolog enriched in _Hydractinia_ pluripotent interstitial cells (i-cells).
- Conducted in vivo immunofluorescence staining for key histone modifications (e.g., H4K16ac, H3K9me3) to characterize distinct chromatin organization across stem and differentiated cells.
- Employed quantitative analysis (CV, Pearson's, Manderâ€™s coefficients) using Fiji and MATLAB to statistically confirm the more open, euchromatic state of i-cells.

ðŸ“„ **Literature review: Targeting Genetic and Epigenetic Mechanisms for Precise Treatment in Rheumatoid Arthritis** <br>
[Read full review (PDF)](PDFs/Review.pdf)
- Authored an academic literature review, synthesising molecular insights into Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) pathogenesis, focusing on the key role of the highly polymorphic _HLA-DRB1_ gene and the critical role of DNA methylation in Fibroblast-like Synoviocytes.
- Analyzed the clinical utility of specific genomic biomarkers for enhancing RA treatment precision, detailing how specific _HLA-DRB1_ variants (e.g. valine at amino acid position 11) can predict favorable patient response to biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs).

ðŸ¤– **GWAS pipeline: Association Testing and QC Analysis** <br> 
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/RowanAllan11/GWAS_pipeline) <br>
- Implemented a robust, reproducible Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) pipeline utilising shell scripting, PLINK and R to process a large dataset of 306,102 variants and 4000 individuals. Successfully executed rigorous Quality Control (QC) filtering and performed logistic regression adjusted for age and sex.
- Applied stringent multiple testing corrections (Bonf, FDR, HOLM), resulting in the identification of 9 genome-wide significant SNPs.

## ðŸ’¼ EXPERIENCE
**University of Galway/Galway University Hospital** <br>
_Research Assistant (May 2025 - Jul 2025)_ <br>
- Research internship under the supervision of Dr. Matthew Dorman, analysing short- and long-read sequencing data from routine Salmonella surveillance in collaboration with Galway University Hospital.
- Presented results to senior researchers, translating complex technical results into actionable recommendations,
outcomes are being developed into first-author publication.
 <br>

**Uri Frank Lab** <br>
_Research Assistant (Jan 2025 - Apr 2025)_ <br>
- As part of my lab placement I cultured the colonial hydroid Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, preparing samples by cutting and collecting polyps using fine surgical scissors; employed SABER-FISH (Signal Amplification by Exchange Reaction - Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization) for in vivo RNA localisation, which required designing and fragmenting transcript sequences into candidate probes, amplification and performing DNA cleanup.
- Performed Immunofluorescence Staining in vivo using primary antibodies, followed by incubation with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies and nuclei staining; and acquired all visual data using the Olympus Fluoview 3000 confocal microscope.
- Communicated research outcomes in both a poster presentation and written thesis, demonstrating the ability to
convey technical insights to diverse audiences.
